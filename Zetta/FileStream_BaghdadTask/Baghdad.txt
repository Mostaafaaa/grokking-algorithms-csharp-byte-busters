Baghdad has always been more than just a city; it is a living chronicle of civilizations. Walking through Baghdad, one feels the echoes of scholars, poets, and philosophers who once turned its streets into the heart of knowledge. The libraries of Baghdad once held treasures of science and literature that shaped the course of history. Even today, Baghdad stands as both a memory and a promiseâ€”a reminder of what was and what could be rebuilt. For anyone who dreams of culture, resilience, and beauty rising from hardship, Baghdad remains an eternal symbol.
